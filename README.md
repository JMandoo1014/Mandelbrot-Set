# Mandelbrot-Set
Mandelbrot Set with PYTHON

2024 Unist Supercomputing Project

## Details
Image processing was parallelized using mpi. Based on the range in which the Mandelbrot set is created, node_h was set using an arithmetic sequence equation.

An image is created in the image folder, and a video can be extracted using open.cv in video.py.
